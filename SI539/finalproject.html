  <h1>Designer check: http://mgoblue.com/ </h1>

<div>✓Make sure there is enough contrast between text and its background color
Its contrast ratio is 8.59:1.</div><br>

<div>✓Don't indicate important information using color alone</div><br>

<div>✖︎Pair values of colors together (not only hues) to increase contrast
<p>Improvement: It applies pairs of contrast color like [blue and yellow] and [blue and white]. But there are not a lot of values of colors to differentiate the information. The headline text in the ‘feature’ and ‘headline’column are easily ignored because their colors are close to the text color. Add some contrasts to these parts.
</p></div>

<div>✖︎Don't rely on sensory characteristics as the sole indicator for understanding and operating content.
<p>Improvement: the enter button in each part of ‘sports filter’ are only shown as an unusually seen icon with no further indicators/explanation which are confusing.
</p></div>

<div>✖︎Design focus states to help users navigate and understand where they are Help users understand inputs, and help them avoid and correct mistakes
<p>Improvement: The “CUSTOMIZE MY MGOBLUE” in bottom need some time to understand how to navigate because there are some misleading title and without enough hints. And “Sign in with Twitter or Facebook to store your selections. (optional):” is not clear as an option.
</p></div>

<div>✓Help users understand inputs, and help them avoid and correct mistakes</div><br>
  
<div>✖︎Write good alt text for your images
<p>
Improvement: It basically describes the content of image, but it is still confusing.
It can have more label naming like adding ‘state:’in front of any state name; adding “logo image:” in front of logo such as ‘NCAA’.
</p>
</div>
  
<div>✖︎If an experience cannot be made accessible, create another route for users to get that information
<p>Improvement: Don’t see any explanation information for video. Add some description of video content.</p></div>
  
<div>✓Be as consistent and clear as possible in layout and copy</div>
